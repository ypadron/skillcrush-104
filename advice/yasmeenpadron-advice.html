		<h1>Hi my name is Yasmeen and I have some advice for you!</h1>
	</header>

	<section>
		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Bust out those Cheatsheets</h4>
			<p>Memorize the common Terminal & GIT commands as soon as you possibly can! Trust me when I tell you that it will make EVERYTHING easier!</p>

			<h4>Join a local Ruby meetup group</h4>
			<p>If there's a local Ruby meetup you can join I encourage you to do it! I find the help that I receive from meetups invaluable and making new friends is always fun.</p>

			<p>In addition to local meetups, you should definitely look for Ruby workshops. I've been to two Ruby workshops for women in the past nine months and I highly recommend them.</p>

			<h4>Keep calm and carry on</h4>
			<p>Try not to get too frustrated when you encounter problems. For me, one moment everything makes sense and I'm making great progress and then a few minutes later I'll encounter a problem that sets me back for hours.</p>

			<p>Coding can be frustrating. When you get frustrated you should take a break.</p>

			<p>Finally, other people have probably mentioned this but it's worth repeating - code a little everyday rather than a lot at one time. I find it's easier to retain information in small bits rather than large chunks. Good luck!!!</p>
